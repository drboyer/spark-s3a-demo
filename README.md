This repo is a proof of concept that runs [Spark](https://spark.apache.org ) within a Docker container where it can interface with S3.

It uses

* Ubuntu 18.04 base image with OpenJDK 8 and Python 3.6
* Spark 2.4.5
* Hadoop 2.7.3 (which I believe is the version the Spark distribution I used was built with)
